Repository Of Semi-Useful Stuff (simple terminal programs)

- How.cpp  
  Google "how something" by simply typing "how something"
- Google.cpp  
  Google "anything" by simply typing "google anything"
- Ubify.cpp  
  Replace all vowels in some text with "ub" for lols or something.  
  Either "ubify" to open a prompt or "ubify some text" to ubify some text.
- DeUbify.cpp  
  Replaces all instances of "ub" in text with random vowels (including y).  
  As ubification is a lossy anti-compression, data is lost. DeUbifying text
  can lead to unexpected results. Enjoy.
